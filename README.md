## how to git in a team

**1. create a new feature branch** for developing (Make sure you're on the master)
```
git checkout -b NewFeatureBranchName
```
**2. Committing, always committing<br>**
It's recommended to commit as often as you implemented anything that works. 
It is your and your team's backup.<br>

**3. Merge, merge, merge: working on small feature branches** <br>
Working with branches can lead to huge merge conflicts. To avoid bigger problems 
merge your feature branch once your feature is implemented and than create a new 
branch for another feature.<br>

**4. git fetch, git pull<br>**
Remember that you always need to fetch and pull once you've checked out the master to 
synchronize your local files with the remote master.
